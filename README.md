# My sxhkd configuration

I use [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd) as a hotkey daemon. This
repo contains its configuration file and some related scripts.

- A file manager: [pcmanfm](https://github.com/lxde/pcmanfm).
- A web browser: [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new).
- An application launcher: [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi).
- A password manager: [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org).
- A tool to control the screen brightness:
  [brightnessctl](https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl).
- A tool to control the PulseAudio sound volume:
  [pamixer](https://github.com/cdemoulins/pamixer).
- A tool to control the music player daemon:
  [mpc](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/mpc).
- A tool to take screenshots: [scrot](https://github.com/dreamer/scrot).
